# Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of the Amn
Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Black Isle Studios. It is the sequel to Baldur's Gate (1998), and was released for Microsoft Windows in September 2000. Like Baldur's Gate, the game is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition rule set.

Baldur's Gate II opens shortly after the events of Baldur's Gate and continues the story of the protagonist, Gorion's Ward, whose unique heritage has now gained them the attention of Jon Irenicus. The game's plot revolves around the protagonist's encounters with Irenicus, and is set south of the events in Baldur's Gate in the country of Amn, mainly in and around the city of Athkatla.

## Kalah's Riddle
A riddle that I single-handedly solved every time I played the game (since 2001!). Created a naive script to check through the answers.
